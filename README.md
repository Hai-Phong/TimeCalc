# TimeCalc
A simple C code to calculate differences between time t1 and t2 (with error check)

Requirement for TimeCalc assignments:
- Input: 2 inputs, t1 and t2, with hh:mm:ss format, the program will take everything before 'enter' or '\n' as a single input
- output: is in this format: err1 err2 result
    + if the input is in wrong format, err = 0; otherwise err = 1
    + result is a string which indicates the result of t2-t1 with sign (ex: +hh:mm:ss or -hh:mm:ss)

If you have any suggestions for my code, feel free to drop some wisdom. Thank you very much
